  "GameDescription": "Welcome to Forbidden Lands. In this tabletop roleplaying game, you are not heroes sent on missions dictated by others â€“ instead, you are raiders and rogues bent on making your own mark on a cursed world. You will wander the wild lands, discover lost tombs, fight monsters, and, if you live long enough, build your own stronghold to defend. During your ad- ventures, you will uncover the secrets of dark powers lurking in the shadows and, in the end, you can be the ones to decide the fate of the Forbidden Lands.",
